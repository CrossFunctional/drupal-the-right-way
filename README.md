# Drupal: The Right Way

## What?

Insprired by _PHP: The Right Way_, _Drupal: The Right Way_ provides an easy-to-read, quick reference for Drupal best practices, accepted conventions and standards, and links to authoritative tutorials around the Web.

## How to Contribute

_Drupal: The Right Way_ is hosted on GitHub Pages. It is a Jekyll project available in the [gh-pages](https://github.com/CrossFunctional/drupal-the-right-way/tree/gh-pages) branch. Fork and edit the [gh-pages](https://github.com/CrossFunctional/drupal-the-right-way/tree/gh-pages) branch, add some examples or helpful links, and send me a pull request. Let's make this the best resource available for new Drupal programmers!

## Where

<http://www.drupaltherightway.com>

## Why

As Drupal continues to grow in popularity, more developers are being asked to take on Drupal projects and failing to follow the conventions and best practices that seasoned Drupal developers have developed. New developers are often overwhelmed and don't know where to start. This repository aims to solve this problem.

## Why not Drupal Docs

The Drupal.org docs have lots of great information in them, but it can be hard to figure out where you find the information you need and it is often the case that developers don't even know to look for that information. The idea here is to provide a 1-pager (albeit a bit lengthy one) that contains all the key points a new Drupal developer should be aware of, with lot of links to more details.
