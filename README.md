### Translations

If you are interested in translating _Drupal: The Right Way_, fork this repo on GitHub and publish your localized fork to your own GitHub Pages account. We'll link to your translation from the primary document.

To avoid fragmentation and reader confusion, please choose one of these options:

1. We link to your GitHub Pages fork with `[username].github.com/drupal-the-right-way`
2. We link to your GitHub Pages fork with a subdomain (e.g. "ru.drupaltherightway.com")

If you use a subdomain, enter the subdomain into the `CNAME` file, and ask us to setup DNS for you. If you do not use a subdomain, remove the `CNAME` file entirely else your fork will not build when pushed.

When your translation is ready, open an issue on the Issue Tracker to let us know.

## Why

As Drupal continues to grow in popularity, more developers are being asked to take on Drupal projects and failing to follow the conventions and best practices that seasoned Drupal developers have developed. New developers are often overwhelmed and don't know where to start. This repository aims to solve this problem.

## Why not Drupal Docs

The Drupal.org docs have lots of great information in them, but it can be hard to figure out where you find the information you need and it is often the case that developers don't even know to look for that information. The idea here is to provide a 1-pager (albeit a bit lengthy one) that contains all the key points a new Drupal developer should be aware of, with lot of links to more details.
