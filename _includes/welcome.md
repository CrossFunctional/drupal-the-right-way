# Welcome

_Drupal: The Right Way_ is an easy-to-read, quick reference for Drupal conventions, 
popular site building approaches, links to documentation and authoritative tutorials 
around the Web and what the contributors consider to be best practices at the present 
time.

_There is no canonical way to use Drupal_. This website aims to introduce new Drupal 
developers to some topics which they may not discover until it is too late, and aims 
to give seasoned pros some fresh ideas on those topics they've been doing for years 
without ever reconsidering. This website will also not tell you which tools to use, but 
instead offer suggestions for multiple options, when possible explaining the differences 
in approach and use-case. 

This is a living document and will continue to be updated with more helpful information 
and examples as they become available.
